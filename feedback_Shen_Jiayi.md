# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.


















### Feedback Week 4:

The code for week 4 is great. There is no need to change anything.


















### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] The code counting nucleotide occurrences and plotting the pie chart works fine, but you should ask the user to input a DNA sequence instead of hard-coding it in the file.




- [ ] The string reversal and sorting code looks fine, but again, you should ask the user for text input.






This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade.
