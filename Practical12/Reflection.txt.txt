The practical is a little bit hard.
Most of my time was spent on the first task "A simple SIR model".
The most difficult thing for me was to use np.random.choice() function and count the number of S/I/R.
I was really excited when I successfully wrote the code.
The most important thing I learned from this practical was to think carefully what happens before actually starting to write the code.
